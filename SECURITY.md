## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **Do Not** Create a Public Issue

Please do not create a GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities as this could expose the vulnerability to potential attackers.

### 2. Report Privately

Send an email to: **security@yourcompany.com** with the following information:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes (if available)

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 72 hours
- **Resolution Timeline**: Depends on severity (1-30 days)

## Security Measures

### Automated Security Scanning

Our CI/CD pipeline includes multiple security scanning tools:

- **Secret Detection**: TruffleHog scans for exposed secrets
- **Dependency Scanning**: Safety checks for vulnerable dependencies
- **Static Analysis**: Bandit identifies Python security issues
- **Code Analysis**: CodeQL performs advanced security analysis
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy scans Docker images for vulnerabilities

### Security Best Practices

1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
2. **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't expose sensitive information
3. **Logging**: Security events are logged for monitoring
4. **Dependencies**: Regular updates and vulnerability scanning
5. **Container Security**: Non-root user, minimal base image, security scanning

### Security Configuration

- **HTTPS Only**: Production deployments use HTTPS
- **Security Headers**: Appropriate security headers are set
- **Authentication**: Secure authentication mechanisms (when applicable)
- **Authorization**: Proper access controls implemented
